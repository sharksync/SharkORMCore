  s.description  = <<-DESC
Shark is an open source ORM, designed from the start to be low maintenance and natural to use, developers choose shark for its power and simplicity.

With just a couple of lines of code getting you started, it is faster to get started than any other database system.

Real class objects are used and extended, with a simple persistence model and the datastore is always refactored to your class structures, with no effort from the developer.

Objects are retrieved using a FLUENT interface, but the same methods give you COUNT, SUM, GROUP & DISTINCT.

Your object model is tuneable with indexes and query optimisations and it is entirely thread-safe in every situation, in fact, you don't have to worry about it at all.
